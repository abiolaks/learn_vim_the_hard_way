# learn_vim_the_hard_way
Making notes and saving the online book: learn vimscript the hard way by steve losh.

This repository is to fascilate offline reading in the absence of internet connection. It is bore out of my desire to want the offline version
of the book and keep track of my learning process. It is strickly for learning purpose alone. I read the online book then copy it and spend time editting it
to solidify what I read while going through the note using vim navigation commands.

As I reread the notes and edit it  and navigate it on vim, makes my learning fun, since i got to play around with the commands I'm learning.

Thanks Sir Steve Losh for this book.
